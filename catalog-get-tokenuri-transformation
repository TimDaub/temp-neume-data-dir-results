As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.  A few hours later \"GG\" (Too O.P. Please Nerf) was born.","project":null,"title":"\"GG\" (Too O.P.

I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.

It was all surreal and kept me in a positive headspace the entire trip. As I celebrate one year in Web3, I wanted to make this release special and take it back to when my community became family. Wouldn’t be here without the folks who believed in me, made me feel heard + seen, and really embraced me.\r\n\r\nI want to dedicate this record to my late uncle but also hope this record resonates with folks everywhere who know that giving up is never the option (even when it feels like the easiest thing to do). I'm here to motivate, uplift, and inspire my community in the hopes that we can all help the next person out.  \r\n\r\nCredits\r\nWritten & Performed by Heno.\r\nProduced by J.Robb\r\nMixed & Mastered by Jose \"Soberseas\" Soberanes\r\nCover Art by Wesley Flores"}},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fiancé Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We’ve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that’s a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement.

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fiancé Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We’ve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that’s a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound.
