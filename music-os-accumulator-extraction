It’s called “in my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits” and it is defined by its uniqueness. I made it smack in the middle of my month and a half in Europe. A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn’t sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now “In my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.” Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can’t wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. 💗Thanks so much here’s to another important release.","project":null,"title":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x1cec06071b6fa9c93d8bca2d1fd33132749548edc0e1cd236cd70b0cb7643561679213bc136588d42892c4a19aa74ab4f59ca8d0446b2b43dcc174878221ae8e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","description":"Okay so for my 4th catalog release I wanted to do something new.

I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn’t sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now “In my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.” Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can’t wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. 💗Thanks so much here’s to another important release."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"10008"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeie5ze3ba6je5ey4c3zandzb6wtvkb3g7pigzmr2lhozkzzrwewhbi"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

The picture is taken by a photographer that goes by the online username of “kruwt”. It’s funny cause I stumbled upon this on Instagram or Twitter randomly, but I loved it so much at first sight that I had to do some research about it. The painting starts from a rejected project that Lemoyne finished for Versailles, but while he was doing something so big he was also suffering a lot. While I was making the tracks you hear now in the EP, I wasn’t into a pretty good mental state and music was the only escape for me. At some point, the fact that I happened to produce something I was happy with made me feel like I’ve overcome a lot of all those demons, so to me the ‘Apotheosis’ subject meant something too. \"","title":"Apotheosis"},"title":"safe","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb2dc9de25af5729e326b0c3c6093dcfb1a872d1a6a19bc325b69080a8e5264ae4e05120855b345dee7d6b63b84fd3db428d5a3d49c8ec60a91981b29e38e466d1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"safe","description":"\" [Safe] seems to symbolize our arrival in the dungeons of the camoufly project, the place where his incessant experimentation takes place and where his fabulous ideas take shape. \" - Alessio Anesi, FUXWITHIT\r\n\r\n\"Safe\" is the second single from my debut EP \"Apotheosis\".\r\nA song that embraces vulnerabilty with mellow but definite melodies, like a shelter from the storm.\r\nA song that features instruments from multiple cultures, all together in harmony.\r\nThis is \"Safe\"."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"2595"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeiaplywzwanr4h6opyjokltjeic63pbykzsf422qqbdfoogoqr6sve"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

I was lacking inspiration and spent a lot of time debating where I should go. For whatever reason I went through my old photos and found a picture from August of 2018 where I was standing at sunset at an overlook at Griffith Park. At the time I was a junior in college and I remember so vividly the overwhelming draw I had to figure out a way to move to Los Angeles one day.

In this way, it expands my boundaries, but in the gravity of the messages I hide both in the sounds, and in the foreign and holistic name titles of my songs, I also intend to expand other peoples' boundaries. Really, everyone says that I'm some genre-bending virtuoso or what have you, and this was my way of trying to live up to that a bit, while putting my signature twist on things. Everything about this album, each song, each name title, the order of the songs, how many songs there are, even in a sense, the duration of the songs and the whole album, were intentionally decided upon and modified to convey my own personal message: to you as well as myself. Interpret it as you will, look up the meanings of the name titles, stare at and bask in the grandiosity that is the album cover, but most importantly, listen intently. As loud as you can.

After independently releasing over 10 albums over the past couple of years, San Diego's very own AbJo has created Soulection's third installment. AbJo has been on our radar for quite sometime and it was only necessary that we created a project that represents both of our visions.\n\nSankofa resembles a soundscape that ranges from Future-Soul, Jazz, Eclectic-Fusion, Hip-Hop, & Deep-Thought sounds that trigger your mind into the thought of what The Sound of Tomorrow should sound like. AbJo designs a sound visual that incorporates heavy snares, hi-hats, future-drums, vintage-pianos, timeless-samples, & crisp synths that bring out your roots.\n\n\"I've been making beats for the better part of 4 years, but I've been musically involved since I was 9, so about 13 years now....There are a lot of influences in my life, but the biggest ones were my father's music collection, my classical music background, The Roots (my favorite hip hop band, period), Dilla and Madlib, and jazz music in general. These days, though, cats like Dibia$e, Freddie Joachim and FlyLo are my biggest inspirations...Sankofa means \"to return from whence you came\", but to me it also means to re-complete the cycle, the same cycle you've been completing since your soul has inhabited this existance; to basically go back to your roots again, renewed and evolved from the last time you progressed, to reflect and be one with yourself again, as you always have been...\"\n-AbJo","title":"Sankofa"},"title":"Kalimba Song","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x7eb2013b2f7bbcd38d196262a1bdad3f17f2c8c06fa8f39505d95993982e175912171cb7b9950483973bcd96511d4485d49a4fa7921e19e5b88869e403b4e1141b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Kalimba Song","description":"The single off my debut release on Soulection, \"Sankofa\", proto-future beats vibes.

The album began while Josh was living in Mexico City. For weeks Josh was living in a small apartment and would walk through the city. One of the streets he walked on was Manzanillo St. and the characters and environment would inspire many of the songs and artwork for the album. Borrowing time from a friend’s small studio and recording in the living room of his apartment, the basics for the album took shape. For most of the year Lippi was touring the world working for other artists and would continue to write in the backstages of clubs, vans, tour busses and planes. On a break between tours Josh pulled a four day stand at the legendary Different Fur studios in San Francisco, CA, literally sleeping on the couch in the control room and put all the pieces together to complete the record. Taking on most of the instruments himself and releasing the record on his own Truth Music Label, Josh Lippi & The Overtimers emote the energy and spirit of DIY music, putting in the overtime work to get things done independently.","title":"Manzanillo St."},"title":"For Nana","trackNumber":6,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xc85dc4a00f3ced5bf3607ee1a4558265486fafe4f576b0cdaa1a57f4ec652c34161a4bfa5b1632c9118392c381401b218b68dde3e42e8f855a4dc0cc5b2db2ed1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"For Nana","description":"Wrote this for my Grandma Rosemary. \n\nJosh Lippi - guitar, upright bass, mandolin, synth\nDerek Taylor - drums\n\nWritten and Produced by Josh Lippi \n\nRecorded at Pedro Y El Lobo studios Mexico City, The Torta Oven San Francisco, CA, and Different Fur Studios San Francisco, CA.\nRecorded & mixed by Seal Paulson and Josh Lippi.\nMastered by Brian Lucey"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"4371"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeifm5eozdm7bteonprwferatuayau44siv4gl5uluqar63lfqa67py"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

Push is a confident step forward from Maral’s club & mixtape work into a powerful collection of original songs. Push’s palette includes a collage of Iranian Classical & Folk samples, and explores genres of experimental electronic production touching upon noise, punk/post-punk, and dub. Maral writes, “I think it represents me wanting the music to Push people towards thinking about sound/music in a different way and me pushing myself to create something new - different than my last record. As well as this feeling towards society - of wanting them to Push to be better and more forward-thinking in how we can make the world a better place.”\n\n“I try to incorporate the philosophy behind Iranian classical music, the importance of improvisation, by letting my samples play around with each other until they become friends. And if they click, that makes a good song,” says Maral. Push bursts with urgent psychedelic energy, but its songs also grapple with a somber undercurrent. “The history of Iranian music has a lot of melancholy in it. So much of Iranian history is sad. Since ancient times, Iranians were always fighting off invasions.” Push heavily features the Setar, an Iranian lute instrument that Maral has played for years and the instrument of choice for Sufi mystics who use it to transcend beyond the notes. Maral adds, “The quiet nature of the Setar allowed it to flourish during times of invasion when Persian culture and music was banned and needed to be played/passed down in secret.”\n\nThe songs on Push feel vividly personal yet constantly besieged by harsh walls of distortion and abrupt shifts. Maral describes it as the sound of fleeting music, where “imaginary band members are being pulled back and forth by a supernatural vortex - suddenly they disappear and reappear as something new. I wanted this record to sound like I was in a band with the samples - where the samples are each a band member. I kind of see myself as the drummer in the band but also I have the lead vocal duties on ‘Sweet Thing,’ ‘No Type,’ and ‘Let The Distortion Sing.’” Releasing tracks with her vocals is a new step for Maral, who reworked the tracks “Sweet Thing” and “No Type” from experiments spanning 4 years with producer So Drove at the Red Bull Music Academy Studios in Los Angeles. They are both love songs, “Sweet Thing” a reassurance to a partner that being together will be “the sweetest thing,” and “No Type” a reinterpretation of the Rae Sremmurd song to say that the partner is “just my type, only thing that I like.” Maral describes Push’s sweeping, transient nature as “this feeling of driving in a car with the windows down and you have your own music playing but also can hear what’s going on outside, and the way those sounds can meld together to create a beautiful song for just a couple of seconds and disappear.”\n\nPush’s marked punk and dub influences are reinforced by intriguing guest features from dub legend Lee “Scratch” Perry and Penny Rimbaud, co-founder of Anarcho-Punk band Crass. “The Penny Rimbaud song came about from me contacting him to show him Mahur Club and to tell him how much Crass has had an influence on me, sonically and philosophically,” Maral writes. “He suggested we collaborate and sent me a poem that I created the song around. The poem is about the events in Iraq and Gaza but can apply to much of the Middle East and the role of western imperialism in that region.”\n\nMaral writes, “At the time that I was making the record, it was when U.S.-Iran relations were really bad. The songs with the Iranian samples have this feeling of spiritual melancholy that is an ingrained part of being Iranian, and I made them thinking about the horrible impacts the sanctions and in general USA’s actions have had on the country and how it just never lets up - the western imperialism that is hell bent on destroying the people in the guise of ‘saving them.’ The songs are kind of my battle of not letting the negative thoughts overcome me and wanting to pass down the beauty and feeling of perseverance that is a part of Iranian culture and music.”","title":"Push"},"title":"Dashti","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x722ed4e7dad7b2af994c6bc296282bbba7e0464bd77d6cc4e4f7e999894b02807f580c30b9896ab0c34f6efaa4505bb3c4931bdd8bdd8db253d97a77e8080b6a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Dashti","description":"Los Angeles-based Iranian-American producer and DJ Maral presents her genesis NFT “Dashti” from her debut album Push (Leaving Records 2020).

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: Holly, Dabow, GOD.DAMN.CHAN, Goodnight Cody, and Call Me. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more. \n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s GOD.DAMN.CHAN also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.''  To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

If the connection and meaning in creativity becomes devoid, there's a transformation process that either channels an ascension or departure. An internal and external battle that can chase and haunt individuals in every part of their life if one falls into the latter position.\n\n\nIn the case of Los Angeles based electronic producer Huxley Anne, ascension was achieved during one of these tests of creative endurance and preservation, entering a phase of her life where the process of feeling art on meaningful levels had subsided for a lengthy period and the eventual reprisal of these natural gifts returned. This led to the creation of her debut album and an expansion in creativity that marks an important beginning for her path as an artist. This work is known as Ilium, representing a moment in Huxley Anne's life that's been one of her most testing yet rewarding mountains to climb. Ilium is Huxley Anne's debut album with Los Angeles indie imprint and Alpha Pup Records affiliate, Dome of Doom. The album will release on limited edition cassette and digital platforms April 14, 2017.\n\n\nTo understand the road to Ilium, there is a specific time and place that initiated its origins. Upon arriving back to the States in February of 2012 after living in France, Huxley Anne found herself unable to feel emotion in the act of observing, interacting and creating art. This remained true for several years while she worked as a tech for one of the world's largest live sound companies. During a visit to the Broad Museum, Huxley Anne encountered an awakening moment while observing Cy Twombly’s 1960s painting “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later).” The duality of tranquility and intensity in emotional response flooded her senses after contact was made with the painting, bringing back a very critical piece of her life. \"I spent thirty minutes in front of one of his masterpieces, “The Rose,” explains Huxley Anne. \"Turning around, I came face to face with Twombly’s “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later),” and in one sublime instant I was overcome with raw emotion, tears bleeding from my eyes with joy and pain and beauty and melancholy and death and desire and the truest feeling I’d been searching for for the past five years. I could feel emotion again and the intensity was overwhelming.\" It had the affect of activating a voyage of artistry that's become lasting fuel in the strength of her soul and the desire to reach from the furthest depths of her creativity to produce art that can live far outside of her reach.\n\n\nWhen diving in even further around the catalyst to Ilium's creation, the biggest influence of the record appears. A few days after Huxley Anne found Cy Twombly’s “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later)” , she read an essay that a friend left in her car, discovering a word that took her to the mental, spiritual and physical realms the painting originally evoked: duende. As Huxley Anne further explains, \"Duende loosely means having soul, a heightened state of emotion, expression and authenticity. The duende is the spirit of evocation, it is what comes out from inside you as a physical/emotional response to art. It is what makes you cry or smile or fall to your knees when hearing a concerto or witnessing flamenco in the streets. Federico Garcia Lorca wrote often about this spirit, stating there are key elements involved: irrationality, earthiness, a heightened awareness of death, and a dash of the diabolical. I believe Lorca, the duende is a spirit who helps the artist see the limitations of intelligence, it reminds you a lobster could suddenly fall on your head, bringing the artist face-to-face with death in order to help create and communicate memorable art. The duende is not virtuosity or talent or work. It is a power, a struggle.\"\n\n\nRecordings for Huxley Anne's debut album took form shortly after this experience at the Broad Museum and her newly sparked connection with the force of duende, finding refuge in her home studio in the beginning hours of 2017 with a storm of sonic visions to explore. The act of deep solitude served the writing and recording process in equal measure, giving her ample space to explore the vast world of sounds that were finalized for the album. Sonically, Ilium is an orchestrated field of unique beauty, drawing together eight tracks of exotic electronic music that calls upon the darkest and most light driven of emotions. Exploratory textures take on vortexes of shape through cinematic sound designs, fluidly traversing between amorphous undertones, intricate composition mapping and pulsing rhythms. Electronic music that's sprouted through emotive songwriting and shape-shifting contours, conjoined in the most dynamic of forms and progressions.\n\n\nFrom the submersion of euphoria to the illumination of power, Ilium draws upon as many influences in the realm of mystical antiquity as it does the landscape of experimental music leading us into the future. A sonic portrait of her ascension through creative turmoil, the struggle of sustained determination and a rebirth into timeless artistry. Huxley Anne has created a boldness in sound that was made with the most vulnerable and giving of sides and simply put, Ilium is the continuation of meaningful life.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n1. Slant\n2.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: God Damn Chan, Holly, Call Me and Goodnight Cody. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more.\n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s God Damn Chan also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.'' To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.","title":"Shimmer, Then Disappear"},"title":"Carry Cash","trackNumber":11,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x2be4e5c24e9ab408fd4668075c05a00d42c11735f7544bd5e97c78cb8589c9cd10f47b8eb6356f946f617c02b73ec3d5b7fd347577a5ce1c9bf09c11c5ccc4eb1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Carry Cash","description":"Hope you got some extra cash to catch the bus"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"5498"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihqfavfyqoo22rdlai736mldbucys7nsu2oq2vyajcszodb6cwowq"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

Penumbra is an introspective work that centers around the emotional vortex of a past relationship with each track serving as a chronological representation of each phase. “To be more on the nose, in order, \"Lilac\" represents the sort of initial honeymoon phase,” Saka adds. “\"Prescient\" represents starting to realize that things might not be so perfect after all. \"Penumbra\" exemplifies right before the breakup, and \"Let me Live\" being right after.” Saka's new EP differs in sound design and structural approach to past works, rooted in the language of songwriter-driven electronic music and accentuated with a sense of unbridled experimentation.\n\n\nOn Penumbra, Saka presents his vocals on record for the first time with “Prescient,” also introducing a new collaborator to his catalog with the last track, “Let Me Live (feat. Amethyst).\" Both pieces are soaked in a wave of deep emotional resonance, supplanted with harmonious lines, amorphous overtones, and complex patterns. Panoramic and tranquil, it sets a unique sense of balance to their counterpart bookends: the dance-floor euphoria of the EPs introductory piece “Lilac,” and the refractacted neck-snapping wild sonics of the title-track. All sides serving as important energetic windows into the type of emotional roller coaster Saka was on during his past relationship. The Penumbra recording sessions began in May of 2020 and the mixing/mastering process was finalized this year by Saka. \n\n\nA lot of the sound design for Penumbra was created on Ableton, mostly centered around the use of the Novation Peak, a synth Saka purchased at the beginning of 2020. Operator, Ableton's native FM synth, was also heavily used in the recording process. Saka adds further insight into the writing and recording behind Penumbra: “I began writing around the concept of Penumbra at the end of May last year. It's actually mostly about an ex, and the feelings I experienced throughout our relationship. Each track sort of represents a different time period of the relationship, in chronological order. I didn't really try to make any of these musical ideas fit into any specific sort of overarching genre, sort of just wrote from the heart in the sonic lexicon that I have. I wrote largely without intention, wanted to get my feelings out in musical format, so the tunes range from beats to DnB to garage. I was pretty patient with myself, I didn't really write this EP with any sort of deadline for myself. In fact, I spent time throughout 2020 largely creatively wandering, trying to figure out where I belonged in this electronic music space I'm in, all the while writing ideas for this throughout the year. I think Penumbra is sort of the culmination of me not really giving that attention anymore. It's really just music I want to hear now that represents how I felt emotionally at the time.”","title":"Penumbra"},"title":"Penumbra","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x57b3ff6fba89256fd6ea50b100008c6a16a435ce56dcb65e279113177b79e42e76ebcb5a19f5d886f30176c2fb204486fc99a97f63f53c8c1f53976d9eaf33a71c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Penumbra","description":"integrate your shadow"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"5499"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibl3hmofiqsounahfd7x5hy7yaclvyz7er2lnuvldgbrv5gse2j4i"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

She was sitting in my patio during a party, smoking a cigarette with the kind of self assuredness that you can't help but admire. It happened immediately for me, but as we started spending more and more time together (largely in part to my giddy persistence), I noticed that the feeling was mutual. But it was more than just the adoration. She knew me better than anyone within five minutes of meeting me.

She was sitting in my patio during a party, smoking a cigarette with the kind of self assuredness that you can't help but admire. It happened immediately for me, but as we started spending more and more time together (largely in part to my giddy persistence), I noticed that the feeling was mutual. But it was more than just the adoration. She knew me better than anyone within five minutes of meeting me. It was in a lot of ways what some people look for their entire lives, but my heart was unsettled and I wasn't ready to give myself entirely to her. I took her love for granted and ultimately lost the privilege of having it.\n\nOver the next 365 days I would learn just how rare what we had was, and process and channel that experience in the most natural way I knew how: music.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

He immediately told me to keep writing music and connected me to his favorite mixing/mastering engineer, Ryan Schwabe.\n\nRyan mastered this track for me and most recently, he mastered my second album infina ad nausea.\n\nThis track signifies a monumental shift in my life that I am still grateful for. It was the beginning of truly following my passions, and I feel like I can hear that every time I listen.\n\nTo whomever collects this, please know: you are now part of this journey too. <3\n\nPhysical unlockables include the only 1/1 pressed vinyl of my EP Absinthe Party in existence and an Infinite Object of the album cover animation video art."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"5770"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeib2ixulsoxiswyrdqke5pgms5ioktd66msig4cbb6iro3wldpljle"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

It’s a conceptual piece that lyrically & visually tells a story of heartbreak, anger, self hatred, unrequited love, & inner-reflection.  A realm familiar to many but often not represented authentically in modern popular music, especially EDM.  Sonically, the production falls into its own unique category, combining elements of electronic dance music with a gritty alternative / industrial soundscape (if Flume & Nine Inch Nails had a baby).  AWAY’s vision with self:antiself & future projects is to help create a new lane sonically & visually, for darker, raw alternative music branching off from the world of electronic dance music & inspire a new era of musicians to push the boundaries of a scene that’s becoming increasingly repetitive & stale.","title":"self:antiself"},"title":"AWAY x Echos - Ritual","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xa8cd705ff19de157e3fdef2ab2bde78424bb904e3efd52c3fa461795ebed80f04f12f3ea44d6d47ed1077f9624b2b5f42d0a18ad92aaee4fd905900bc7b8da9b1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"AWAY x Echos - Ritual","description":"Hey, I'm AWAY & this is my first ever NFT drop.

It was fall and I was in Malibu making Whethan's album Fantasy with a few of my closest friends. We didn't really see anyone else for a few weeks, some days we'd work on the songs together, others we'd all contribute separately and intermittently check in on each other's progress. Every day was pretty much exclusively filled up with Fantasy, but towards the end of the retreat we had gotten a general layout of the album and decided to take a 24 hour break to reset and check back in the following day with fresh ears.\n\nIn the morning, I decided to take some mushrooms and meditate. The house was this Mediterranean palace placed right on the edge of a mountain, overlooking the ocean with a sprawling backyard. I sat myself in the grass and closed my eyes, just as the shrooms started hitting. I got a little anxious about thirty minutes in, but this voice in my head started softly repeating \"surrender to the moment, stop trying to control it\" and when i listened, it brought me a peace that had a melody attached to it. Ten minutes later I'd written deep breath in the sun, and that little mantra repeating in my head can be heard in the outro of it. \n\ni got really emotional after laying deep breath down. i couldn't stop crying thinking about my mom, and how i probably would never know how it felt to be a mother looking at their child. images of me as a baby in a sea of sheets, her gentle voice lulling me to sleep were clear in my head, it all felt so profound. i heard in my head what i thought it must have felt like to be her, tender and fragile but also unshakable and unequivocally deep. i ran inside with tears still in my eyes, sat at the grand piano, and recorded what became do you know how much i love you. to this day i regard it as the most powerful piece of music i've ever made.\n\nAt sunset, we drove down to the beach and i hopped in the water as the sun went down. The image used for this piece was a super8 frame from that moment. Everything was so beautiful. I was with some of my best friends of my entire life, swimming in southern california, and had just made two of my favorite songs ever. We went back up to the house and in the glow of twilight i hopped on a trampoline at a property across the street with my friend Tak taking photos on his Contax. That's where the album cover art came from. \n\nAn hour later the sun had gone down and I was sitting on the floor of wheaty's room playing guitar. I was still pretty high when a full blood moon started rising up out of the ocean, running a glowing red streak across its surface. I felt so connected to the universe at that moment I swore I could hear it talking to me, and I went outside with a couple of buddies and started just howling. I went back inside, picked up the guitar, and tracked the first half of can you hear the moon sat down on the floor. I met everyone downstairs for dinner, talked a while and went back upstairs and finished it.\n\nAfter we'd left Malibu I realized just how much those songs meant to me, and how much sense they made together. So I made them flow nicely into one another, polished them up individually, and turned it over to the world as The In Between.\n\nI hope that this body of work has or does resonate with you as much as it has for me.\n\nThe winner of this piece will receive:\n\n- (2) VIP tickets to any non-private/festival Grady shows in perpetuity\n- Access to a token gated archive of demos/ future releases by Grady via $LOVE tokens\n- The In Between signed poster\n- The  In Between t-shirt\n- The In Between .jpeg file\n- The In Between .wav file\n\n25% of all secondary sales will go to a non-profit voted by $LOVE token holders.","project":null,"title":"The In Between","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x575c57cb1549a8e19aed71e25e6fa33ad9343d6ad637c561d1114b5c06a49af661dbd63b570d8d845e83c1df827a2b504525d166b9743d53c0803393513071dc1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"The In Between","description":"This project was made over the course of 14 hours two years ago and it changed my life forever.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

the years, i’ve realized how powerful words are— how they cause life to shift and set the tone of our expectations. i paid attention to how just by speaking of good, good would come. and that has caused me to be a lot more intentional with the words that i say. i wrote “and so it’s so” the first day i attended NFT NYC before i even left the house. before i even met my NFT tribe. i was nervous to be stepping into this new space. wasn’t really sure of what to expect, but something told me i could expect something wonderful. and that’s exactly what that day was. love in it’s purest form. abundant creativity. i was surrounded by black, brilliant, soon-to-be billionaires. but more than that, they felt like family. they felt like answered prayers for supportive community. so i figured, what better way to begin my NFT journey than with the song that set the tone for such an amazing beginning?\n\nthis photo was taken by Latasha, who is a trailblazer in this space and has been such an inspiration to my NFT journey. she caught me mid-happiness. i love this shot so much. this song was produced by Kaelin Ellis, who literally makes audible magic. i call him the wizard. and this song was written and performed by me, Iman Europe, who i think is just the greatest (: , and recorded and engineered by the sound doctor, Matt Cody.\n\nsince this record is all about affirmation, the winner of this NFT will also receive a signed copy of my self-published affirmation book, “Nami Says”, along with a framed copy of the lyrics + a handwritten note. i wish the winner of this NFT many wonderful days, peace, and unfathomable abundance.\n\nand so it’s so.\n\nlyrics:\nwake up in a new day with sensation. let go of my yesterday frustrations. ‘cause all of my lessons, they turn into my

so it's so.","description":"over the years, i’ve realized how powerful words are— how they cause life to shift and set the tone of our expectations. i paid attention to how just by speaking of good, good would come. and that has caused me to be a lot more intentional with the words that i say. i wrote “and so it’s so” the first day i attended NFT NYC before i even left the house. before i even met my NFT tribe. i was nervous to be stepping into this new space. wasn’t really sure of what to expect, but something told me i could expect something wonderful. and that’s exactly what that day was. love in it’s purest form. abundant creativity. i was surrounded by black, brilliant, soon-to-be billionaires. but more than that, they felt like family. they felt like answered prayers for supportive community. so i figured, what better way to begin my NFT journey than with the song that set the tone for such an amazing beginning?\n\nthis photo was taken by Latasha, who is a trailblazer in this space and has been such an inspiration to my NFT journey. she caught me mid-happiness. i love this shot so much. this song was produced by Kaelin Ellis, who literally makes audible magic. i call him the wizard. and this song was written and performed by me, Iman Europe, who i think is just the greatest (: , and recorded and engineered by the sound doctor, Matt Cody.\n\nsince this record is all about affirmation, the winner of this NFT will also receive a signed copy of my self-published affirmation book, “Nami Says”, along with a framed copy of the lyrics + a handwritten note. i wish the winner of this NFT many wonderful days, peace, and unfathomable abundance.\n\nand so it’s so.\n\nlyrics:\nwake up in a new day with sensation. let go of my yesterday frustrations. ‘cause all of my lessons, they turn into my blessings with more patience. so i’m proclaiming, / that this day is gonna be wonderful. i said it, and so it’s so. and so it’s so. this day is gonna be wonderful. i said

With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character.

The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection.

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character.

The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection. But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"All The Ideas","trackNumber":8,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xa008fdd937c21a8a73bd00008220638b412e06a1701a084e6a048847d27bc9c8375ec0c5bd901d9a3f774735d0fcbb2927754062e92ef237245946be743077051b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"All The Ideas","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project.

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character. Though the character I am trying to convey through Hvdson is essentially ‘not human’, the underlying, fundamental truth coming from the music touches upon a common emotion that has recently been more prominent in the information age - loneliness. The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection. But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"Epilogue","trackNumber":7,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xbe36e4628b15a4d185ac98ae03bc09c5ea81125f08ffb4f72422ba73f136585375258366a66b85fde8d1374fbd24f39abf4cde4cd23683a4eb254c8422fffd0a1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Epilogue","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project.

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character. Though the character I am trying to convey through Hvdson is essentially ‘not human’, the underlying, fundamental truth coming from the music touches upon a common emotion that has recently been more prominent in the information age - loneliness. The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection. But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"Cross My Mind","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x16bf0c159ab0b4deedd6241481de992db37f4ac0b773ed6d397f684a54c4b7d20c5f7039b2a6bc48dc1d41a8bb1838ee551f76c1b1ddf810e787e532031ce9021c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Cross My Mind","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project.

With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character.

The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality.

The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

Feel the bass vibration hit your body and buss a gun finger with this Leftfield bass & Dubstep seleck.\n\nBASSW8 is a hypnotic, percussion heavy EP with slaps hard with all its wobbles! “It’s almost like Yung.raj travelled back 15 years to the Sublow, 8 Bar, Pre-Grime beginning of Dubstep ''... (Jamiro Vanta aka Sola Plexus)\n\nThe name of the EP is inspired by this documentary called BASSWEIGHT that featured all the pioneers and the ogs that Yung.Raj watched as a kid which left a heavy heavy impact on him.\n\nArtwork by Denver Fernandes","title":"BASSW8"},"title":"BASSW8","trackNumber":2,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xc0bafffcff3feecc30acf9b5b52ad25cd11bed9ca222f27611f8f3e03b2839cf52099ffdc8ef2fb709960be8333e5159269d780575828563241f32d8e17ae70d1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"BASSW8","description":"Debut 4NC¥  Music NFT collab with Yung.Raj, celebrating the first artist to release on the label.

It became apparent that the more I tried to excessively control situations, my direction, my creativity, my productivity, etc., I was sure to feel more friction in those areas. Trying to control your creativity is a sure fire way to get blocked up. Overworking often makes you feel so burnt out that the quality of your work decreases, despite spending more time doing said work.

Trying to control your creativity is a sure fire way to get blocked up.

Released in December of 2019 after months away from home on tour.  Drained but with good intentions.  Sad but hopeful.  I remember being obsessed with wood during the time of making this song, which is probably how it got this title.  Wood as in the material.  I started to buy a bunch of hand-crafted wooden furniture/designs for my studio and was super into the texture, the smell, the feel of it.  I wasn't sure why my heart was pulled to it.  One day I got a tarot card reading and the person literally said, \"Putting yourself around wood would be really good for you right now, something grounding... try to maybe go to a forrest\". I'm open minded of course but it was definitely odd to hear the synchronicities in the tarot-readers advice.  Maybe I smelled like wood. \r\n\r\nIt's part of the V2 series which is more so, stream of consciousness styled stuff.

Released in December of 2019 after months away from home on tour.  Drained but with good intentions.  Sad but hopeful.  I remember being obsessed with wood during the time of making this song, which is probably how it got this title.  Wood as in the material.  I started to buy a bunch of hand-crafted wooden furniture/designs for my studio and was super into the texture, the smell, the feel of it.  I wasn't sure why my heart was pulled to it.  One day I got a tarot card reading and the person literally said, \"Putting yourself around wood would be really good for you right now, something grounding... try to maybe go to a forrest\". I'm open minded of course but it was definitely odd to hear the synchronicities in the tarot-readers advice.  Maybe I smelled like wood. \r\n\r\nIt's part of the V2 series which is more so, stream of consciousness styled stuff.  Almost with a demo-structure to it rather than songs that abide by some rule of arrangement.   \r\n\r\nI'm happy this song is out in the world.  I had a deep seated feeling of fear before putting it out, because of how vulnerable it was.

If there is no frame, no goal, no direction, we have to consider Gaia as the name of the process by which variable and contingent occurrences have made later events more probable.

I hope you enjoy. 😉"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"7569"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeieffwf5rkxxqpjmhhms242eb4v7ugzczqoz7vhvtirt4lggtkiqi4"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

My most honest.” The EP exemplifies this by opening with “an audio play on maintaining the balances between one’s relationships and how communication and love from within is key” before diving into the rest of the project. By its conclusion, the listener unveils both a new sound from the producer (i.e. the title track) and songs like “Crazy”, which represent the sound that Lakim’s audience fell in love with.

is a poem i recorded after a huge fight with a former partner and our families. her friends exposed her for cheating, and while confronting her, our family members got into a shoving match which ended in a single slap (between men) and her calling the police.\n\nstanding there, drowning in absolute despair and rage, now surrounded by police, I looked in her face as she, her sister & mother frantically told the police that I was armed and dangerous (I'm licensed to carry firearms, like most American ppl) and that I had drugs and guns in the house (which wasn't true. well, the drugs part at-least). this activated the police because they were using racist dogwhistles to get them to arrest or injure/kill me, but after they checked me and confirmed that I was unarmed, the police and my

her, our family members got into a shoving match which ended in a single slap (between men) and her calling the police.\n\nstanding there, drowning in absolute despair and rage, now surrounded by police, I looked in her face as she, her sister & mother frantically told the police that I was armed and dangerous (I'm licensed to carry firearms, like most American ppl) and that I had drugs and guns in the house (which wasn't true. well, the drugs part at-least). this activated the police because they were using racist dogwhistles to get them to arrest or injure/kill me, but after they checked me and confirmed that I was unarmed, the police and my family shared a moment of silent disgust, wondering how folk who claimed to love me could flip a switch and try to get my freedom/life taken away, all over one persons embarrassment. because she was so ashamed of her actions and how the community would react, she attempted to sacrifice me to reinforce her victim narrative, which not

Those experiences strengthened my resolve to ship my music even more.\r\n\r\nAdditional Perks For The Collector:\r\n⁃Airdrop of my “Collector Key” NFT, which gives access to the NFT-Gated Collectors chat in my discord which will receive updates on the aforementioned project as we get closer to its announcement and release\r\n-Video chat with me if you’d like\r\n⁃My endless gratitude and love\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nProduced by: Lackhoney\r\nWritten by: Lackhoney\r\nMixed + Mastered by: Lackhoney\r\n\r\nA Fun Fact: \r\nThe voice in the intro of the song is a voicemail, my roommate, Knowledge left me saying: “Ay low key it’s not important but I wanted to leave a message so you could save it so I could be on the album.”\r\n\r\nThis one isn’t for the album, but he made it on my Catalog Genesis, which is probably even cooler.\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n[Intro: Knowledge’s Voicemail]\r\nAy low key it’s not important,\r\nAy low key it’s not important but I wanted to leave a message so you could save it so I could\r\nSave it, Save it,\r\n\r\n[Verse 1: Lackhoney]\r\nShabbat shalom okay uh,\r\nHallelujah, my neighbor,\r\nMy skin looks brown as fuck I’m khaki-colored, Jake from State Farm,\r\nI ain’t really half a singer but I autotune okay, uh,\r\nI learned the skills I got because belief was in my nature,\r\nTry to play me like a fool I fool around and turn the table,\r\nPlaying pool with my boo and a dude tried scooting I pulled out the 'K,' let spray up,\r\nHow’s your day?

The release of this project marks a huge milestone for us after it took about a year and a half straight of cataloging songs and discovering exactly who we want to be as a band. Not only considering sonics, but everything in between from our mission, image, and foundational goals. It took blood, sweat, and many tears to get exactly what we were looking for from this project, and with the executive production help of Fever 333 frontman, Jason Aalon Butler, as well as some production love from My Chemical Romance, and Green Day’s long time producer, Rob Cavallo, we were able to give BOYS DO CRY the legs it needed to run. \r\n\r\nWhat the phrase “boys do cry” means to us is that we often are told the right answer is to suck it up and not let your emotions drive you. While this may work for some, we feel that sometimes, it is okay to pause, and cry… before you keep going. Showing emotions can be something we as a culture shy away from, which makes us want to put our flag in the sand and say “hey, we struggle with this shit too, we cry, and that’s okay if you do as well”. We are all in this weird little life together, let’s love, support, and lift eachother up. It’s okay to feel the way you do.","title":"BOYS DO CRY"},"title":"DEMONS","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xf6cec02b06e6530db53c4323db12aa609b1daf68fcfd331c39d2b393b914c9a17ba9f9e02d18930331360890eecd25d83f9e849a77f350d795a78d6f1dbf39c71c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"DEMONS","description":"The owner of this NFT will receive:\r\n\r\n- The master .wav file of the song\r\n- The master.jpeg of the EP cover art\r\n- The mixed stems for the master project\r\n- 1 All Access Pass + 1 to any BSD show annually airdropped (not including festivals)\r\n- 1/1 Custom leather jacket with colors and symbols of your choosing\r\n- A special thanks for being the owner of a BOYS DO CRY NFT, 1000 Dropout ($DRPT) Token airdrop \r\n- Access to a token gated portal of unreleased demos and an Alpha Channel in our Discord.\r\n\r\n- 50% of this NFT's proceeds will be allocated to our community treasury that will eventually provide liquidity for our $DRPT Token and other community endeavors. \r\n- 10% of all secondary NFT sale royalties will be allocated to the community treasury."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"7882"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihodi3pcd2tjpzxfkuoo32psls4joxj7fgzhybr3uvrylcscsendq"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

While this may work for some, we feel that sometimes, it is okay to pause, and cry… before you keep going. Showing emotions can be something we as a culture shy away from, which makes us want to put our flag in the sand and say “hey, we struggle with this shit too, we cry, and that’s okay if you do as well”. We are all in this weird little life together, let’s love, support, and lift eachother up. It’s okay to feel the way you do.","title":"BOYS DO CRY"},"title":"Coming Down","trackNumber":2,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xf2dfa2b6a5171e2435152650a87804fd1b0c4b55f8f6d650565137bb7ee9de904d5c5f0b3ffe5119dfe484724fe272b68e49d4ddf28c20e5456a401e06f873a61c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Coming Down","description":"The owner of this NFT will receive:\r\n\r\nThe master .wav file of the song\r\nThe master.jpeg of the EP cover art\r\nThe mixed stems for the master project\r\n1 All Access Pass + 1 to any BSD show annually airdropped (not including festivals)\r\n1/1 Custom leather jacket with colors and symbols of your choosing\r\nA special thanks for being the owner of a BOYS DO CRY NFT, 1000 Dropout ($DRPT) Token airdrop \r\nAccess to a token gated portal of unreleased demos and an Alpha Channel in our Discord.\r\n\r\n50% of this NFT’s proceeds will be allocated to our community treasury that will eventually provide liquidity for our $DRPT Token and other community endeavors. \r\n10% of all secondary NFT sale royalties will be allocated to the community treasury."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"7879"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibaij3tgzn3zkoz7dej3gqlziltxs4xgzgi6cx5e4tmofhz462zem"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"phase runner","trackNumber":7,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xd0a67996343e5299c48fea227bccf8ecb39eabf4167f8b6ea17743e0bc3bc8486ab1fcf01da51eef3b68fbb29f9c916f23e78429ca2f8f889d6b7228afd7658e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"phase runner","description":"“phase runner\" is the seventh track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" and the third NFT minted of this series.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the first auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made), as well as a 1-hour gaming session on Apex Legends with Dot (played remotely, can swap for a zoom hangout if not a gamer). \r\n\r\nNFT owners from the Life Support series will also gain access to exclusive listening parties and events (both online and IRL) for new releases coming later this year.

Our maniacal, border-line hyperactive personalities fit together like a two-piece puzzle, so it was only right when we linked up in 2015 for a Los Angeles writing session. Cut to a Sawtelle Blvd. lockout studio, smelling of stale blunt smoke, with muffled, out of key 808’s leaking from underneath the doors.

The release of this project marks a huge milestone for us after it took about a year and a half straight of cataloging songs and discovering exactly who we want to be as a band. Not only considering sonics, but everything in between from our mission, image, and foundational goals. It took blood, sweat, and many tears to get exactly what we were looking for from this project. With the executive production help of Fever 333 frontman, Jason Aalon Butler, as well as some production love from My Chemical Romance, and Green Day’s long time producer, Rob Cavallo, we were able to give BOYS DO CRY the legs it needed to run. \r\n\r\nWhat the phrase “boys do cry” means to us is that we often are told the right answer is to suck it up and not let your emotions drive you. While this may work for some, we feel that sometimes, it is okay to pause, and cry… before you keep going. Showing emotions can be something we as a culture shy away from, which makes us want to put our flag in the sand and say “hey, we struggle with this shit too, we cry, and that’s okay if you do as well”. We are all in this weird little life together, let’s love, support, and lift eachother up. It’s okay to feel the way you do.","title":"BOYS DO CRY"},"title":"Slipping Away","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x8597596d25c7a1e4bd27e5c5b26f5dd21a803375bd31689c606075d938675f487ec480401a5c0ae492c547e1d49e9017a9954dade09e99e53ef17fbad09e38e21b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Slipping Away","description":"The owner of this NFT will receive:\r\n\r\nThe master .wav file of the song\r\nThe master.jpeg of the EP cover art\r\nThe mixed stems for the master project\r\n1 All Access Pass + 1 to any BSD show annually airdropped (not including festivals)\r\n1/1 Custom leather jacket with colors and symbols of your choosing\r\nA special thanks for being the owner of a BOYS DO CRY NFT, 1000 Dropout ($DRPT) Token airdrop \r\nAccess to a token gated portal of unreleased demos and an Alpha Channel in our Discord.\r\n\r\n50% of this NFT's proceeds will be allocated to our community treasury that will eventually provide liquidity for our $DRPT Token and other community endeavors. \r\n10% of all secondary NFT sale royalties will be allocated to the community treasury."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"7878"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeig5qidbwsognigvdwm5sviktos3kpfvgt46yajrekeow7c6636pfy"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

I had saved up three years of streaming royalties to buy a used mic and audio interface and was still learning how to use them properly. Looking back, this song represents a turning point in my journey as a self-sufficient artist and creative.\r\n\r\nLove’s Like Drumming is important to me for a number of reasons. The first and most superficial is that it’s my first song to hit a million streams — minting it is a way to celebrate that milestone.

I had saved up three years of streaming royalties to buy a used mic and audio interface and was still learning how to use them properly. Looking back, this song represents a turning point in my journey as a self-sufficient artist and creative.\r\n\r\nLove’s Like Drumming is important to me for a number of reasons. The first and most superficial is that it’s my first song to hit a million streams — minting it is a way to celebrate that milestone. More importantly, it was one of the first songs that I fully produced, mixed, and mastered myself. \r\n\r\nAdditional Perks For The Collector:\r\n⁃ Airdrop of my “Collector Key” NFT, which gives access to the NFT-Gated Collectors chat in my discord which will receive updates on the major unannounced project I’m working on as we get closer to its announcement and release\r\n- Video chat with me, if you’d like\r\n⁃ My endless gratitude and love\r\n\r\nA Fun Fact:\r\nThe voice throughout the song is a voice-memo from my baby cousin, another reason I love it.

There are out of tune, wonky vocals, cat meows in the background, keyboard clicks, and some lyric-less vocal takes, but I think the process is just as interesting as the finished product.\r\n\tEach song comes with a unique cover art created by me based on the original album cover art mock up I made. \r\nThis is the start of a new chapter and I am thankful to have you with me.","title":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (The Demos)"},"title":"I Couldn't Wait (Demo Version)","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xa0f79ffb02fabbb8801489c97c79ce3058c7853ce3ccf3acb423ba0bd7c13b0b1a3e6c0f34bcd1a6fb2ea9cbd9a0ba24011fc0bafbacbbbdb7eb995062adbabd1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"I Couldn't Wait (Demo Version)","description":"I Couldn’t Wait was the very first song I started writing after I finished my second album.

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"keep on","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x232ab25ce33977bee7c02dd3c7a4eda76e0eefacc1d091be1a888f01e8749c7b23c36f0af4a0822cf298b19aeacccb1f7dd11aec54082f2f30869ff4b96c336b1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"keep on","description":"“keep on\" is the opening track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" and the fifth NFT minted of this series.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the primary auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made). \r\n\r\nNFT owners from the Life Support series will also gain access to exclusive listening parties and events (both online and IRL) for new releases coming later this year.

I minted a song called “Forever”, which came out of sessions for my second album. Since then, I’ve been immensely excited about how much Web3 can change the music industry. \r\n\tI wanted my genesis NFT project to be something that exists exclusively in Web3 because I believe that power in music lies in ownership and community, both of which are not inherent to the artist and their fans in old music models. \r\n\tThis demo album is not about polished, finished songs, but about the process in making them. There are out of tune, wonky vocals, cat meows in the background, keyboard clicks, and some lyric-less vocal takes, but I think the process is just as interesting as the finished product.\r\n\tEach song comes with a unique cover art created by me based on the original album cover art mock up I made. \r\nThis is the start of a new chapter and I am thankful to have you with me.","title":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (The Demos)"},"title":"The Stars (Indiana Demo Version)","trackNumber":10,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x81c701c32dc9bf5be1b7cfb0b1985d5c8dd809407801972fc4a762d6715af4d37f967b9fa50515172fed1fa68a45dbe4402fe2923f27c4a647a3f0831f21ab5e1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"The Stars (Indiana Demo Version)","description":"The Stars was called Indiana after the file name BJ Burton sent me, until the final hour.

The duo visited one of the woodland-hideouts that Jane and her friends frequented as teens, coined \"White Elephant\". White Elephant is a fallen, uprooted tree, deep in the Mackinac woods and acted as a secret hang out spot. Its roots (pictured in the album art) run much deeper than what is exposed. Similar to the kind of friendships that start at a young age, the roots are never truly separated from the soil. Everyone always comes back. \r\n\r\nThe duo wrote the song to capture the feeling of revisiting the familiar wooded landscape of their youth, with the same friends who have been enjoying it for decades. FINKEL wanted to further articulate this connective tissue by bringing in Michigan-native, Illa J, to talk about his spot when he was growing up in Detroit. FINKEL have been fans of Illa J's for years, so getting to tell this story with his help was an incredible full-circle moment. \r\n\r\n\"White Elephant\" was produced by Josh Stadlen, mixed by Khushi, and mastered by Dale Becker.\r\n\r\nAdditional Perks For The Collector:\r\n⁃ Invitation to FINKEL’s private listening party for their album “Islanders” at their studio in East Hollywood, California. \r\n- 1 vinyl of “Islanders” (Delivery of vinyl is TBD based on manufacturing timeline) \r\n- Free entry to 1 FINKEL concert of your choice (no expiration) \r\n⁃ A hug when we meet you in person","project":null,"title":"White Elephant ft.

The duo visited one of the woodland-hideouts that Jane and her friends frequented as teens, coined \"White Elephant\". White Elephant is a fallen, uprooted tree, deep in the Mackinac woods and acted as a secret hang out spot. Its roots (pictured in the album art) run much deeper than what is exposed. Similar to the kind of friendships that start at a young age, the roots are never truly separated from the soil. Everyone always comes back. \r\n\r\nThe duo wrote the song to capture the feeling of revisiting the familiar wooded landscape of their youth, with the same friends who have been enjoying it for decades. FINKEL wanted to further articulate this connective tissue by bringing in Michigan-native, Illa J, to talk about his spot when he was growing up in Detroit. FINKEL have been fans of Illa J's for years, so getting to tell this story with his help was an incredible full-circle moment. \r\n\r\n\"White Elephant\" was produced by Josh Stadlen, mixed by Khushi, and mastered by Dale Becker.\r\n\r\nAdditional Perks For The Collector:\r\n⁃ Invitation to FINKEL’s private listening party for their album “Islanders” at their studio in East Hollywood, California. \r\n- 1 vinyl of “Islanders” (Delivery of vinyl is TBD based on manufacturing timeline) \r\n- Free entry to 1 FINKEL concert of your choice (no expiration) \r\n⁃ A hug when we meet you in person"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"8329"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSmduGE7rk5LRqEoJtCAgwgP7CP638KbGHReyQhJoAZaw"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

It's got Thook's telltale growl with Flume's metallic synths. \r\n\r\nThe second half goes into more uncharted territory with my own sound design techniques. Most of the sounds in that chorus are manipulated samples of my vocals.

Between Fall 2012 through Winter of 2013, I locked myself up in my bedroom everyday and toiled over recording and mixing songs that would eventually form this new album, “Desire.”\r\n\r\nI really wanted “Desire” to have an eclectic sound to reflect the different sounds I’ve been listening to while recording the album. In particular, I found Bibio’s 2011 album, “Mind Bokeh” an inspiration in terms of eclecticism and wanted to achieve that same level of variety. I also found myself taking inspiration from a lot of my peers on soundcloud who make beats, post-dubstep, chillwave and techno tracks. I knew I wanted my sound to be very “electronic” but I also made it a point to sound warm, organic and imperfect.\r\n\r\nProduction-wise, I’d like to believe that this is my best sounding album yet. It has been a great learning process for me making this album. I found myself learning and re-learning new things in recording, mixing and mastering. I had always admired high production sounds but I also wanted the intimacy of a bedroom-produced album.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the lofi and gritty feel, most of the songs here were recorded in one-go. I also utilized home made percussions and field recordings. Sample sources include old tapes, youtube tutorials and j-pop. All of which were chopped and manipulated then rearranged to be come the backbone on most of these tracks.\r\n\r\nCollaboration was also something I heavily pursued in this album: both musically and visually. I collaborated with Davao City’s (Philippines), Skymarines on “Candy Flavored Lips.” The look and feel of the album, which is a nod to the japanese aesthetic, was courtesy of the talented visual artist Krystal Perez and features Shanghai-based photographer and artist, Mang.\r\n\r\nI did not have any working theme throughout the album but ended up making songs that I feel are somewhat connected to each other. “Desire” is a deeply emotional and personal album for me and I sincerely hope that you find something in here that you connect to. I invite you to listen to it and if you like it, you would pass it along to your friends and loved ones.","title":"Desire"},"title":"Getting to Know You","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x6311dc83848f882d8069375481f438874451a1a8ff4334f92cf11392f99b816670b38a508126ac54df39cb225d5c357afd24181dbf0b5479597da9cfb547ac2a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Getting to Know You","description":"Originally released on April 2013 under my previous moniker \"spazzkid\".

My music is a journal and biography of my life that i will praise and enjoy til i say peace out from this wonderful world. \r\n\r\nHere's the lyrics for all to enjoy:\r\ncoulda sworn you looked familiar!\r\nwhere’s the time gone, right?\r\nthe same place that pretty face\r\nwould just dance away with the night\r\ncome light my fire just one more time \r\nwould you deem it a crime \r\nto remind me of\r\nhow the\r\nstreetlights passed \r\nour moments?\r\nour emotions\r\nhid in motions.\r\ni missed our passion.\r\ndid you notice? \r\ni’ll roll da highlights in the morning\r\ncause our movie scenes \r\nwill play for centuries\r\nin all my daydreams\r\nso pretty baby\r\n\r\ntell me if you want me (darling)\r\nat the top of your lungs \r\nis there warmth between us?\r\ndoes it ever burn like the horizons above?\r\nand you won’t believe your eyes\r\nat all the damn stars \r\nflying through your mind\r\nif  iiiiiii come through tonight\r\n\r\nso tell me if you want me\r\nbaby i don't know \r\nwhat's in yo mind\r\nwhat's in yo mind\r\nwhats in yo miiiiiiind\r\nbaby i can't stand it\r\nwill you tell me so \r\ni'll know before you go\r\nOooooOoooOoOoO\r\n\r\ntell me if you want me (darling)\r\nat the top of your lungs \r\nis there warmth between us?\r\ndoes it ever burn like the horizons above?\r\nand you won’t believe your eyes\r\nat all the damn stars \r\nflying through your mind\r\nif  iiiiiii come through tonight\r\n\r\nso tell me if you want me\r\ntell me if you want me \r\ndarling oooooo no no\r\ntell me if you waaaant me\r\noh no no no\r\ntell me if you want meee\r\ndarling OOooOoooOOo\r\n\r\ntell me if you want me babay\r\ntell me if you want me bby\r\ntell me if you want me babay\r\noh noOOoOoOooo"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9357"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmdg8pLjLTsXi8LWpNju77vx7HRSYrFsUYhDH9BLchTDW3"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

I also want this song to remind us to still pay attention to those IRL connections and listen to our minds and bodies when we start to feel stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLyrics \r\n\r\nVerse 1 \r\nI think that I know you Or maybe I don’t Were friends on Instagram You like all my quotes \r\nWe talked in the DM’s but that’s only digital Damn it I need friends This feeling is pitiful we’re just strangers stuck in this timeline \r\nI smile in my photos Pretending like I’m fine I’ve been stuck in this hole I tried crawling out You said I never call Well this is me calling now \r\nChorus \r\nMost of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I feel so disconnected Most of my friends are Stuck on the Internet \r\nI long for real connection Most of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I feel so disconnected \r\nMost of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I long for real connection \r\nVerse \r\nI need to go out side and feel the wind in my hair If I unplugged who would really care We plug in And I just got a shut off notice \r\nGoogle searches can find where my hope is I can remember the last time I was touch That’s strictly platonic Keystrokes aren’t enough \r\nI’ve been stuck in this hole I tried crawling out You said I never call Well this is me calling now \r\nChorus \r\nMost of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I feel so disconnected Most of my friends are Stuck on the Internet \r\nI long for real connection Most of my friends are \r\nStuck on the Internet I feel so disconnected Most of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I long for real connection \r\nRefrain \r\nMost of my friends are Stuck on the Internet I feel so disconnected Most of my friends are Stuck on the Internet \r\nI long for real connection \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nSongwriting by James Gardin\r\nProduction by James Gardin\r\nArt by James Gardin"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9641"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmb7ZvPNRHoHgkrTyvwLp9Yzf8XfTH7XaooC2GyH9G66j5"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

When I got home from the contract, I put more time into the track, adding more swing to hi-hats, some bass, and a few minor mixdown changes.

The music burns with an unabridged intensity, completely different from his last body of work, Buried At Sea. The unhinged and experimental nature of the label’s ethos shines brightly across the new work, defined through a duality of futuristic progressions in electronic music and past influences forged from a multitude of genres. Many traditional mathematical concepts and references are scattered throughout the song titles and factored into the modeling efforts of the compositions themselves, bridging together the surreal and the measurable; the infinitely unattainable with the tangible. Lemniscate will be pressed in a limited edition run of 100 cassette tapes and will be available on streaming services worldwide. \n\nFeatures and collaborations comprise the bulk of the recordings on Lemniscate, bridging together many minds from the Dome of Doom family: AHEE, Holly, CLYDE, Gangus, and SnakeFoot. Wylie Cable adds further insight on why he selected the musicians found on the new LP, “When I chose people to collaborate with I always want it to be someone who's artistic decisions I already naturally enjoy, that way I don't have to spend time trying to steer the project one direction or another, and you get to let people do what they are most talented at without restraint. All the projects with collaborators on the album went through many stages of change, in most cases starting as an in-person session that we then sent back and forth over and over, kind of like a process of refining and filtering a precious substance.” Every artist is integral to the shape of the whole, blending their personalities and styles with a cohesion that sticks to the surface of the LP’s flow.  \n\nConceptually, Wylie Cable found inspiration for the design of Lemniscate in his obsession with the concept of infinity and its mathematical entanglement with the spiritual concepts of the afterlife and the infinite nature of reincarnation and past selves.  \n\n“In algebraic geometry, a lemniscate is any of several figure-eight or ∞-shaped curves. The word comes from the Latin \"lēmniscātus\" meaning \"decorated with ribbons\", from the Greek λημνίσκος meaning \"ribbons\",  or which alternatively may refer to the wool from which the ribbons were made” - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate \n\nUnlike all the previous works in his catalog, Wylie Cable visualized the concept for Leminscate in one lightning-bolt like experience during a late-night work session. Quickly documenting his vision on a set of note cards as each part of the record revealed itself, Wylie Cable describes the experience in more detail, “I was sitting in my house late at night near the end of last year, probably around 3 am just writing and sketching in my notebooks and brainstorming ideas, then suddenly I was hit with this huge flash of inspiration.  The title for the album, the names of the tracks, the collaborators I wanted to be involved, all sort of suddenly fell in my lap in a moment. I frantically wrote it all down on some note cards I had laying around and the process for making the album started.  This is interesting to me because usually, my process involves making lots of music and then finding what from a collection feels like an album. This was almost the opposite process, where I got the full concept for a record all at once and had to build the parts one by one to fill in the conceptual piece in my mind.  Many song names on the album make references to \"lemniscate\" and the concept of infinity. I think this album is also a reflection on our inevitable death and the cyclical nature of life.” \n \n\nWylie Cable added a number of unique instrumentation across Lemniscate that gives its tonality a bold and fierce magnetism, including this year’s newly released analog synthesizer module from Moog, Sirin, as well as Oberheim’s Viscount Joint Venture, Arturia’s Keystep, the renowned mid-70s vintage synth Octave Kitten, and his late father's Fender Jazz Bass. A fusion of electronic influences spanning the last three decades emerges when listening to the album front to back, speaking the language of Dome of Doom’s creative force. Revered hip-hop artist Jonwayne mixed a large portion of the record, with labelmate Gangus taking on mastering duties. \n\nLemniscate begins with a tremendous jolt of energy, the first song “Aleph (feat. AHEE)” combines ‘90s era Drum & Bass dance floor energy with the forward-leaning beat-centric ethos of LA’s underground music scene. A close friend and labelmate, AHEE is the first collaborator on the album and created all the bass sounds in the track with the Prophet X. Most of the piece was co-written in the studio by both artists, with Wylie lacing the entire piece with a montage of synth melodies and AHEE programming drum rhythms. The song charges through quick rhythm changes and arrives at a haunting quarter-time breakdown, composed later on in the process by Wylie, that explodes with a darkened state of surrealism.  \n\nPortugal’s Holly contributes on the exotic, smoldering, and dynamic pace of “Decorated With Ribbons.” Holly’s raw and intense mixture of sidewinding rhythms and sample chops crystallizes through every measure, balanced by the more meditative and slow-moving sections composed by Wylie that are draped with sitar and vocal contortions. Wylie also recorded live flute performances by MJ Noble at his home studio, layering and composing with the raw recordings the same way someone would rip samples from their favorite jazz record to make new melodies with. These added live recordings help create one of the most peaceful and beautiful sections across the entire album. Wylie Cable and Gangus’ “Oculus Non Vidit” is one of the album’s most powerful pieces, incorporating Middle Eastern scales, syncopated drum patterns influenced by the likes of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, and quickly shifting sections that feel like a heightened state of controlled chaos. It’s one of the most palatable and universal songs of LP, suited for large speaker systems deep in nature. \n\n\"Mobius Strip,\" a collaboration with United Kingdom’s CLYDE, is a hypnotic and album defining tune that takes the listener through the evolution of their respective sounds and finds a middle ground that feels like new sonic material for both artists. The track revolves around a cyclical yet unmeasurable vocal chant, with deep sub-bass rhythms changing and shifting to create a wide array of feelings and styles in one song. “Wool” features the ever-expanding talents of Snakefoot, calculated and precise in measure cycles, sample variation, and overall structure.  The album’s conclusion is meditatively somber, rich in a drowned array of guitar and analog driven electronics devoid of drums. The guitar samples were recorded by venerable Los Angeles-based musician Kenny Segal and played by Ryan Crosby, a frequent collaborator on many of Segal's productions and songs. Wylie Cable chopped, flipped, reversed, stretched, and further mutilated the recordings into a dream-like sequence meant to evoke the late writer Nabokov sitting in his hotel in Montreux, examining his butterfly collection and knowing that this is his life's final chapter. \n\nLemniscate is an album that finds Wylie Cable turning internal voyages and collaborative efforts into a vortex of sound. A footprint in the search for what else life has to offer after we transition and the memories that we leave behind when charting intersecting paths.  \n\nPurchase/stream Lemniscate here:  https://domeofdoom.lnk.to/Lemniscate\n \nTracklisting: \n\n1.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: Holly, Dabow, GOD.DAMN.CHAN, Goodnight Cody, and Call Me. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more. \n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s GOD.DAMN.CHAN also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.''  To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

Akin to the electronic avant-gardism one would expect from the likes of Aphex Twin or Daedelus, Cable’s “The Lure of Personal Success,” is a colorful, deeply textured patchwork of sonics that densely incapsulates a wide range of futuristic sounds. Matched with similarly gripping abstract collage work from Dewey Saunders, whose visuals have previously accompanied work by Anderson .Paak, Future, and Griz, Cable’s \"Shimmer, Then Disappear\" LP looks to be the producer’s reflective output in response to the monumental shifts the world has experienced, and ultimately, where we may be headed from here.\" - Dancing Astronaut"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9703"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeifme477udwilf36obvbi4jmwvhc3x6rkgu2tun2sfsiqq2azk63lm"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}
