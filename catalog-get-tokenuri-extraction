Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement. The production is intentionally sparse, to leave room for the vocal and message of the song. ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù was a successful song in web2.\r\n\r\nThis song came out first in 2015, and appeared on my debut album \"Portrait in Two (2017). \r\n\r\nCollector receives:\r\nPearl a capella\r\nairdrop of my upcoming collection\r\n\r\nlyrics:\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nThe portrait of us now, a one way mirror\r\nSilence speaks so loud, you couldn't be clearer\r\nYou're a thousand miles out, wish we were nearer\r\nI'll always fight the wave no doubt, forever I'm here cause\r\n\r\n[Pre Chorus]\r\n(I'll always remember) The butterfly's when we had our, first kiss in LA\r\n(I'll always remember) It was summertime and I can feel the heat in the eyes you gave me\r\nDo you remember the promises made to you the first night I stayed\r\nI'll never surrender, you know together were better\r\n(always remember)\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Interlude]\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou\r\nYou're my pearl, you're my, you're my pearl, you're my","project":null,"title":"Pearl","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4791c0b4a644203d03a47564d9b4e16aa3fac2a5fd6833de24282a9b66152edc531b6a10b7ce3b18a7f8d62a8e81af72d92f107fc3ef51e7f6ab121a1dcf928a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized.

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúin my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits‚Äù and it is defined by its uniqueness. I made it smack in the middle of my month and a half in Europe. A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can‚Äôt wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. üíóThanks so much here‚Äôs to another important release.","project":null,"title":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x1cec06071b6fa9c93d8bca2d1fd33132749548edc0e1cd236cd70b0cb7643561679213bc136588d42892c4a19aa74ab4f59ca8d0446b2b43dcc174878221ae8e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound.

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.

A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can‚Äôt wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. üíóThanks so much here‚Äôs to another important release.","project":null,"title":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x1cec06071b6fa9c93d8bca2d1fd33132749548edc0e1cd236cd70b0cb7643561679213bc136588d42892c4a19aa74ab4f59ca8d0446b2b43dcc174878221ae8e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement. The production is intentionally sparse, to leave room for the vocal and message of the song. ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù was a successful song in web2.\r\n\r\nThis song came out first in 2015, and appeared on my debut album \"Portrait in Two (2017). \r\n\r\nCollector receives:\r\nPearl a capella\r\nairdrop of my upcoming collection\r\n\r\nlyrics:\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nThe portrait of us now, a one way mirror\r\nSilence speaks so loud, you couldn't be clearer\r\nYou're a thousand miles out, wish we were nearer\r\nI'll always fight the wave no doubt, forever I'm here cause\r\n\r\n[Pre Chorus]\r\n(I'll always remember) The butterfly's when we had our, first kiss in LA\r\n(I'll always remember) It was summertime and I can feel the heat in the eyes you gave me\r\nDo you remember the promises made to you the first night I stayed\r\nI'll never surrender, you know together were better\r\n(always remember)\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Interlude]\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou\r\nYou're my pearl, you're my, you're my pearl, you're my","project":null,"title":"Pearl","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4791c0b4a644203d03a47564d9b4e16aa3fac2a5fd6833de24282a9b66152edc531b6a10b7ce3b18a7f8d62a8e81af72d92f107fc3ef51e7f6ab121a1dcf928a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.

At the time, he was using FL Studio to produce (which I also used 2005-2012) so every chance I had, I did my best to convert him over to Ableton Live =)  \r\nHe was very resistant since he was already familiar with FL Studio and Ableton can be daunting because there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

I'm here to motivate, uplift, and inspire my community in the hopes that we can all help the next person out.  \r\n\r\nCredits\r\nWritten & Performed by Heno.\r\nProduced by J.Robb\r\nMixed & Mastered by Jose \"Soberseas\" Soberanes\r\nCover Art by Wesley Flores","project":null,"title":"Fold Proof","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x491fedb7e920b891df76be64fc71904960c6665972e0eb5b2e2eae1980dd8c57310ab0a87aa258502d4bcadfb98127431390039c7818836347dd232ca6837a8c1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

A new song, new for me, a new collaborator, a new style adding onto the sonic palette I‚Äôve been shaping throughout the past few years. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúin my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits‚Äù and it is defined by its uniqueness. I made it smack in the middle of my month and a half in Europe. A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can‚Äôt wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. üíóThanks so much here‚Äôs to another important release.","project":null,"title":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x1cec06071b6fa9c93d8bca2d1fd33132749548edc0e1cd236cd70b0cb7643561679213bc136588d42892c4a19aa74ab4f59ca8d0446b2b43dcc174878221ae8e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement. The production is intentionally sparse, to leave room for the vocal and message of the song. ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù was a successful song in web2.\r\n\r\nThis song came out first in 2015, and appeared on my debut album \"Portrait in Two (2017). \r\n\r\nCollector receives:\r\nPearl a capella\r\nairdrop of my upcoming collection\r\n\r\nlyrics:\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nThe portrait of us now, a one way mirror\r\nSilence speaks so loud, you couldn't be clearer\r\nYou're a thousand miles out, wish we were nearer\r\nI'll always fight the wave no doubt, forever I'm here cause\r\n\r\n[Pre Chorus]\r\n(I'll always remember) The butterfly's when we had our, first kiss in LA\r\n(I'll always remember) It was summertime and I can feel the heat in the eyes you gave me\r\nDo you remember the promises made to you the first night I stayed\r\nI'll never surrender, you know together were better\r\n(always remember)\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Interlude]\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou\r\nYou're my pearl, you're my, you're my pearl, you're my","project":null,"title":"Pearl","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4791c0b4a644203d03a47564d9b4e16aa3fac2a5fd6833de24282a9b66152edc531b6a10b7ce3b18a7f8d62a8e81af72d92f107fc3ef51e7f6ab121a1dcf928a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.

A new song, new for me, a new collaborator, a new style adding onto the sonic palette I‚Äôve been shaping throughout the past few years. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúin my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits‚Äù and it is defined by its uniqueness. I made it smack in the middle of my month and a half in Europe. A down day sandwiched in between double booked sessions and a music video to be shot starting at 5am the next day in Dungeness. I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized. I am so excited for whoever will come to own this song and this little piece of me and can‚Äôt wait to see the life it will live outside this moment, beyond Catalog, and in the world. üíóThanks so much here‚Äôs to another important release.","project":null,"title":"In My Hotel Room Distracting Myself From the Lawsuits (w/ Harris Cole)","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x1cec06071b6fa9c93d8bca2d1fd33132749548edc0e1cd236cd70b0cb7643561679213bc136588d42892c4a19aa74ab4f59ca8d0446b2b43dcc174878221ae8e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things).

One day, My friend Matt E.J. (PharcydeTV/OrganicBeatSessions) came thru to work on music.  At the time, he was using FL Studio to produce (which I also used 2005-2012) so every chance I had, I did my best to convert him over to Ableton Live =)  \r\nHe was very resistant since he was already familiar with FL Studio and Ableton can be daunting because there are multiple ways to achieve the same result. So as always,  my selling point was to show how quickly I work in Ableton. So I let him choose the sample, and 30 minutes later...\r\n\"My Hatin' Jawn\" was born.","project":null,"title":"\"My Hatin' Jawn\"","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x0fea569e041511c6f0115fb86ad2168cb28b5cc58295d8c099985a302670b68a308f1ed2c2cb8f98f92c7245f5301a5d45674b140bb22b2584833132415f77201b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.  A few hours later \"GG\" (Too O.P. Please Nerf) was born.","project":null,"title":"\"GG\" (Too O.P.

I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music.

Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement. The production is intentionally sparse, to leave room for the vocal and message of the song. ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù was a successful song in web2.\r\n\r\nThis song came out first in 2015, and appeared on my debut album \"Portrait in Two (2017). \r\n\r\nCollector receives:\r\nPearl a capella\r\nairdrop of my upcoming collection\r\n\r\nlyrics:\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nThe portrait of us now, a one way mirror\r\nSilence speaks so loud, you couldn't be clearer\r\nYou're a thousand miles out, wish we were nearer\r\nI'll always fight the wave no doubt, forever I'm here cause\r\n\r\n[Pre Chorus]\r\n(I'll always remember) The butterfly's when we had our, first kiss in LA\r\n(I'll always remember) It was summertime and I can feel the heat in the eyes you gave me\r\nDo you remember the promises made to you the first night I stayed\r\nI'll never surrender, you know together were better\r\n(always remember)\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Interlude]\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou\r\nYou're my pearl, you're my, you're my pearl, you're my","project":null,"title":"Pearl","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4791c0b4a644203d03a47564d9b4e16aa3fac2a5fd6833de24282a9b66152edc531b6a10b7ce3b18a7f8d62a8e81af72d92f107fc3ef51e7f6ab121a1dcf928a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.  A few hours later \"GG\" (Too O.P. Please Nerf) was born.","project":null,"title":"\"GG\" (Too O.P.

One day, My friend Matt E.J. (PharcydeTV/OrganicBeatSessions) came thru to work on music.  At the time, he was using FL Studio to produce (which I also used 2005-2012) so every chance I had, I did my best to convert him over to Ableton Live =)  \r\nHe was very resistant since he was already familiar with FL Studio and Ableton can be daunting because there are multiple ways to achieve the same result. So as always,  my selling point was to show how quickly I work in Ableton. So I let him choose the sample, and 30 minutes later...\r\n\"My Hatin' Jawn\" was born.","project":null,"title":"\"My Hatin' Jawn\"","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x0fea569e041511c6f0115fb86ad2168cb28b5cc58295d8c099985a302670b68a308f1ed2c2cb8f98f92c7245f5301a5d45674b140bb22b2584833132415f77201b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

I had a lot stressing me out at the time and wanted to spend my day relaxing and catching up on sleep (this did not happen). I was stressed about getting music turned in and not missing my train in the morning. The high of international travel had worn off and I was ready to be home. Safe to say I was overwhelmed, couldn‚Äôt sleep, and chose to cope with it by sitting down and writing new music. Me and Harry had been working on some ideas together and I revisited one and knew this was the perfect song to encapsulate my current lonely, compartamentalized state. I set up a small studio in my room and made the rest of what is now ‚ÄúIn my hotel room distracting myself from the lawsuits.‚Äù Once it was finished, Harry and I knew this would be a perfect Catalog release and began the process of getting it finalized.

Growing up, that's all that would be played around the house: jazz and gospel. Albeit, my pops would play a lot of \"smooth\"  jazz in the house. As I got older, I began to discover the earlier jazz legends like Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Bobby Hutcherson, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Miles, and so many more. \r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my studio one morning in January 2022 hitting a wall with creating music. I had no ideas and my motivation was waning. \r\n\r\nAfter my morning journaling session, I opened Ableton, pressed record, and played whatever came out at the moment on the piano. It was liberating, to say the least. \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I removed all expectations of creating something that I thought would be \"good\". I realized that I begin to falter when I obsess about how \"good\" something sounds or is perceived in comparison to the previous thing I've heard or seen, which then bars me from even desiring to create anything.\r\n\r\nI began to recenter myself around the earlier days of when I first started making beats in middle school and staying up all night just figuring stuff out and creating things. I recentered myself around the moments when I was learning how to play cover songs on the piano on YouTube just for the sake of learning them. I recentered myself around how joyous it is to create what's in your mind and bring it to life and what a blessing that is.\r\n\r\nResurgence is me finding my way back to my music by stripping away everything and recentering myself around my foundation; the joy of creating music.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that if/when those moments hit you, remember to go back to the moments where you first fell in love with the process.\r\n\r\nThank you to my bro Shaughn Cooper for capturing this photo.","project":null,"title":"Resurgence","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb088b7c88c8a8d2d1cf699c54b084652a7e761f75d52b294110d63bcae0f354c505f347c41b4a5ec6a21675f5baf2665b52af20b5b05001e83b31989d98214e81b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

It's my 1st song I wrote when I committed to becoming a songwriter in 2015, at 21 when I moved to NYC. I've been wanting to commemorate this first step moment for a while now. This one is dedicated to my fianc√© Vanessa.\r\n\r\nPearl is about when I first met, Vanessa. With her in so many ways, my music career began. When we first met almost 8 years ago, I had just begun taking music seriously. She was truly my north star. she believed in my music more than anyone else, and at times more than I did. We did long distance for years before we made our home in Los Angeles and Pearl is directly about the strength of our love for one another. \r\n\r\nReflecting over half a decade later, I've learned so much as a human, as a musician, and as a partner. Proud moments, mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, beautiful memories we've shared; I've grown and evolved into the person I am today. We‚Äôve grown so much personally and professionally together. I would not be where I am in my career without her strategizing moves, giving me tangible feedback, A&Ring and getting in the weeds with me and that‚Äôs a fact. Through it all I'm so grateful for Vanessa who has been truly the Pearl in my life (among so many other things). The constant that has always shine a bright light in the darkest and brightest of times. \r\n\r\nSonically, Pearl was one of my earliest forms of blending of styles and genres that have become a big part of my sound. I mixed this record and intricately layered the a vocal arrangement. The production is intentionally sparse, to leave room for the vocal and message of the song. ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù was a successful song in web2.\r\n\r\nThis song came out first in 2015, and appeared on my debut album \"Portrait in Two (2017). \r\n\r\nCollector receives:\r\nPearl a capella\r\nairdrop of my upcoming collection\r\n\r\nlyrics:\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\nThe portrait of us now, a one way mirror\r\nSilence speaks so loud, you couldn't be clearer\r\nYou're a thousand miles out, wish we were nearer\r\nI'll always fight the wave no doubt, forever I'm here cause\r\n\r\n[Pre Chorus]\r\n(I'll always remember) The butterfly's when we had our, first kiss in LA\r\n(I'll always remember) It was summertime and I can feel the heat in the eyes you gave me\r\nDo you remember the promises made to you the first night I stayed\r\nI'll never surrender, you know together were better\r\n(always remember)\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Interlude]\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\nYou, you're mine\r\nMy pearl, my shine, oh you\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou\r\nYou're my pearl, you're my, you're my pearl, you're my","project":null,"title":"Pearl","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4791c0b4a644203d03a47564d9b4e16aa3fac2a5fd6833de24282a9b66152edc531b6a10b7ce3b18a7f8d62a8e81af72d92f107fc3ef51e7f6ab121a1dcf928a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"}}

As a kid and young adult,  I only played RPG's because the soundtracks were always dope, especially JRPGS.  I took a decade off of playing video games, then ended up getting sucked into Destiny after an EX recommended it.  My backstory as a musician began in the mid 90's,  so battle rap was first love,  why is this relevant?  cus PVP in Destiny gave me that same competitive rush that emceeing did in the mid to late 90's,  so when i wasn't getting lost in nature, or making music, I was sweating in the crucible (PVP) =) \r\nI began to notice,  my music sessions would end up better after playing a little PVP to wake my brain,  so after i turned off the Xbox,  I loaded up Ableton and loaded up an old session titled \"Reset\" ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/reset - which I originally uploaded to soundcloud to celebrate 10k followers 6 years ago ) and I instead of refining it,  I ended up wiping the slate clean and try to breath new live into.
